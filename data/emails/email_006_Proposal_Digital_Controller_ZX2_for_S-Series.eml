Hello Voltway Team,

We’d like to propose our new **Digital Controller ZX2** as an upgrade path for your **Analog Controller ZX** (P301).  
Key benefits:
- 20% improved throttle response  
- Built-in temperature monitoring  
- Drop-in form factor (no re-routing of cables needed)

We can sample 50 units by **2025-04-20**. Let me know if you’d like a pilot order.

Best regards,  
Mia Chen
