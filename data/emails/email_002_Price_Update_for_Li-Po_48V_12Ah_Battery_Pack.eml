Hello Voltway Team,

Effective **2025-05-01**, the unit price for **Li-Po 48V 12Ah Battery Pack** (used in all V2 models, part P302) will increase from **$78.50** to **$85.00**.  
This is due to raw material cost increases for cobalt and specialized cell coatings.

If youâ€™d like to lock in current pricing for any upcoming orders, please confirm by **2025-04-15**.  
We can process a blanket PO to cover Q2 consumption at the old rate.

Regards,  
Jin Wu
