Hello SupC Team,

Please cancel Purchase Order **O5021** for **Carbon Fiber Frame** (part P303).  
We’ve decided to delay the V1→V2 upgrade rollout, so we no longer need these frames.

Let me know if there are any cancellation fees. If so, please send an updated invoice.

Thanks,  
Jordan Lee  
Warehouse Manager
