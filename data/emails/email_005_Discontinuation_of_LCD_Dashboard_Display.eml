Hi Engineers,

Weâ€™re discontinuing the **LCD Dashboard Display** (part P312) at the end of Q2 2025, replacing it with an OLED unit.  
Last buy date is **2025-06-15**; after that, we cannot supply any more LCD displays.

Please update your BOMs accordingly or submit a final PO by **2025-05-15**.

Thanks,  
Raj Patel
