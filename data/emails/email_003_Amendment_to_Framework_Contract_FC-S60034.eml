Hi Voltway,

Under our existing framework agreement (Contract **FC-#S60034**), we’d like to adjust the monthly minimum quantity for **S2_V2** scooters from **200 units** to **150 units** starting May 2025.  
This is due to slower fleet rollout in the West Coast region.

Please review and send back a signed amendment by **2025-04-10**. If we don’t hear back, we’ll assume the old minimum remains in place.

Cheers,  
Marisol Delgado
