Hi Team,

I’m writing to let you know that Purchase Order **O5007** (S1 V1 500W Brushless Motor, part P300) is now delayed.  
Our production line experienced a tooling issue last week, so the expected delivery date has shifted from **2025-03-20** to **2025-04-05**.

We apologize for the inconvenience—this is the first time we’ve had a delay of this length.  
Please let me know if you need any interim stock or partial shipment.

Best,  
Ana Torres
