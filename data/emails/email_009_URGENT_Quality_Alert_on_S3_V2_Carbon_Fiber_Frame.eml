Hi Engineering Team,

During our final QC check, we identified **hairline cracks** on several units of the **S3 V2 Carbon Fiber Frame** (part **P323**).  
Affected batch: PO **O5023**, shipped 2025-04-10.

Photos attached show stress points near the rear mount.  
We recommend halting assembly on incoming frames from this batch and returning the lot for inspection.

Please advise on next steps for containment and replacement orders.

Regards,  
Mark Nguyen
